Machine Learning projects done in University.

## Handwritten digits

Three features are taken into account: vertical symmetry, upper half intensity and lower half intensity.

### 3D Plot

Each axis is a different feature. Each digit is plotted with a different color.

### Sum of intensities

By adding the intensities of each row and each column, we get better results than the 3D plot.

Rows are shown in blue, and columns are shown in red.
